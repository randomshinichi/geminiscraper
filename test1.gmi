# Solderpunk versus the windmills: a Gemlog

Welcome to my Gemlog!  I write about all sorts of things, but recurring themes include: decentralism, minimalism, privacy, simplicity, and sustainability/environmentalism (most frequently in relation to technology, especially computers and the internet, but I'm interested in these things in all spheres), cycling (especially with simple and/or old bikes), photography (especially with simple and/or old cameras - are you seeing the pattern?) and outdoor recreation (especially if I got there by bike and brought a camera with me).
